Ironhack first project 

I came up with the concept of the game based on everyone's favorite viral videos from the 2000's. 
I wanted it to have two concepts; a visual/audio experience and a fun game where you can win and lose. 

The idea is to collect all 20 video clips and as many bitcoins as possible. 
The player gets 50 points for each video collected and 10 points for each bitcoin. 
The player can try to beat their high score each time. 

Every time a video is collected, a screenshot appears and a short audio clip plays. 
This adds to the fun, light-hearted experience. 

There are 'trolls' in which the player has to avoid. 
If the player hits a troll or goes outside of the canvas height/width,the player will lose and has the option to restart the game. 
If the player collects all 20 videos without being hit by the troll, they win. 

I use HTML5(canvas), CSS and JavaScript.
